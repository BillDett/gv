# GV - Grand View

A DIY take on the old DOS GrandView app that was very good at managing outlines.


Bugs
* Backspacing on first character of a child headline when parent level more than 1 less (due to join/split activity)
* Backspacing on first character of last empty headline (hitting twice) causes crash
* (Seems like backspacing on first char of a headline is mostly busted)
