# GV - Grand View

A DIY take on the old DOS GrandView app that was very good at managing outlines.

To Do
* More navigation (PgUp/PgDown, Home, End)
* Selecting text (shift-navigate)
* Copy/Cut/Paste Headlines
* Collapse/Expand Headlines (use bullets to indicate status)

Ideas
* Instead of managing one outline at a time, manage a directory of outline files.  Have an Organizer on LHS of screen with a list of outlines.  When gv starts, focus is on Organizer- create new outline, or select an existing one.  Then edit the outline, ESC takes you back to Organizer.
* Better use of color (everything doesn't need to be green).
